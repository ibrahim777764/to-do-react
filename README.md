## React Tutorial from Scratch– A Step-by-Step Guide (2021 Update)

This repo holds all the code for a React todos application. You can follow the step by step [guide to building the awesome project here](https://ibaslogic.com/react-tutorial-for-beginners/).

## [Click to See the Todos App](https://ibaslogic.github.io/react-todo-project/)

The code is available in the `src` folder. In there, you’ll see two folders named `classBased` and `functionBased` holding the class component and function component code respectively.

### Clone the project

You can download or clone this project by running this command from your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Ibaslogic/react-todo-app
```

This will create a directory in the name of the project folder.

Once you have the project files and folders bootstrapped, open it with your text editor.

Next, switch inside the project directory and run:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies in the local `node_modules` folder.

Finally, start your development server by running:

```
npm start
```

You should see the app in your browser address bar at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
